# GDPR Compliance in Recruitment: What You Need to Know

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has fundamentally changed how organizations handle personal data, and recruitment is no exception. With the increasing digitization of hiring processes, ensuring GDPR compliance in recruitment is not just a legal requirementâ€”it's essential for building trust with candidates and protecting your organization.

## Understanding GDPR in Recruitment Context

### What is GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a comprehensive data protection law that came into effect in May 2018. It applies to all organizations that process personal data of EU residents, regardless of where the organization is located.

### Key Principles for Recruitment

- **Lawfulness**: You must have a legal basis for processing candidate data
- **Transparency**: Candidates must understand how their data is used
- **Purpose Limitation**: Data should only be used for stated purposes
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only what you need
- **Accuracy**: Keep candidate data up to date
- **Storage Limitation**: Don't keep data longer than necessary
- **Security**: Protect data with appropriate measures

## Legal Basis for Processing Candidate Data

- **Most Common Basis**: Processing is necessary for legitimate business interests
- **Balancing Test**: Weigh your interests against candidate's privacy rights
- **Documentation**: Keep records of your legitimate interest assessments

### Consent

- **Explicit Consent**: Clear, specific, and informed agreement
- **Withdrawable**: Candidates can withdraw consent at any time
- **Granular**: Separate consent for different processing activities
- **Documentation**: Keep records of when and how consent was obtained

### Contract Performance

- **Employment Contract**: Processing necessary for employment relationship
- **Limited Scope**: Only data needed for the employment relationship
- **Clear Purpose**: Specific and legitimate employment-related purposes

## Candidate Rights Under GDPR

- **Withdrawal of Consent**: If consent was the legal basis
- **Unlawful Processing**: If data was processed unlawfully
- **No Longer Necessary**: If data is no longer needed
- **Objection**: If candidate objects to processing

### Right to Data Portability

- **Machine-Readable Format**: Provide data in structured format
